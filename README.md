# mosfet-motor-driver

This repository contains the design files for a custom 4-channel MOSFET motor driver PCB built around the IR2104 half-bridge driver IC.
The board is designed to be compact, efficient, and easy to integrate into robotics and automation projects.


Features:

- 4 independent motor channels (can drive 4 DC motors simultaneously).

- No heatsink required – efficient layout and copper design handle typical current loads.

- IR2104-based half-bridge design for reliable high-side/low-side control.

- Copper pours and optimized track widths for safe current handling.
